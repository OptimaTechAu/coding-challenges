Supermarket Kata
================

Develop a serverless solution using AWS Lambda and .NET Core to simulate a supermarket checkout system. The system should process scanned items and return the total price, applying any applicable special offers. There should be an emphasis on clean coding principles.
## Requirements

A busy supermarket needs a modern, serverless checkout system to handle their daily transactions. Each checkout lane will be powered by an AWS Lambda function that processes scanned items and calculates totals in real time.
Supermarket items are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs — represented by letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Items are priced individually, but some items have multi-buy special offers: purchase N of them and they will cost Y pence instead of their combined unit price.
For example, item A costs 50p individually, but with this week's special offer, buy three As and they cost only 130p.
The checkout accepts items in any order. If a B, then an A, then another B are scanned, the system must recognise the two Bs and apply the special price of 45p (giving a running total of 95p). Pricing rules change frequently, so pricing must be independent of the checkout logic.

### Example items

| SKU | Unit Price | Special Price |
|-----|-----------:|---------------|
| A   | 50     	   | 3 for 130     |
| B   | 30     	   | 2 for 45      |
| C   | 20     	   |               |
| D   | 15     	   |               |


The checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we will recognize the two Bs and price them at 45 (for a total price so far of 95). The pricing changes frequently, so pricing should be independent of the checkout. The interface to the checkout could look like:

```csharp
interface ICheckout
{
    void Scan(string item);
    int GetTotalPrice();
}
```
